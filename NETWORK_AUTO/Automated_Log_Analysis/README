# Automated Log Analysis Tool (Python 3.10+)

This Python script provides an automated solution for analyzing logs from multiple sources, identifying potential security incidents, and generating a daily report. 

## Features

- Parses logs from multiple sources:
  - Firewall logs
  - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs
  - Authentication logs
- Identifies potential security incidents based on predefined rules
- Generates a daily security incident report

## How It Works

1. **Log Parsing**: The script reads log files from three different sources (firewall, IDS, and authentication logs) and parses them into a structured format. (Each one has its own format. If the format of the log is different, 
  the code must be revised)

2. **Incident Identification**: It analyzes the parsed logs to identify potential security incidents, such as:
   - Denied connections in firewall logs
   - Alerts from the IDS
   - Failed login attempts

3. **Report Generation**: The script generates a daily report summarizing all identified incidents, including details like the type of incident, timestamp, and priority.


## Future Improvements

- Integration with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time alerting
- Additional log source support
- More sophisticated incident detection rules
- Historical data analysis and trend reporting
